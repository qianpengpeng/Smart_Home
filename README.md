Smart home system based on ChipKit WIFIRE and Android APP
Smart home is a new network technology based on the development and design of the Internet of things. This design uses the chipKIT Wi-FIRE development board provided by Microchip as a platform. In the Ardiuno environment, the PIC32MZ2048EFG100 is programmed. A simulated intelligent home system is built by adding LED lamp, DC motor, temperature and humidity sensor, and smoke sensor. The whole system uses Socke through the WiFi module. The letter is connected to the Internet. The Android app design is carried out. The control of the lighting and DC motor of the smart home system by app is realized through the Socket communication mode. The temperature and humidity are collected and displayed to the Android app interface, the combustible gas and the smoke alarm.
